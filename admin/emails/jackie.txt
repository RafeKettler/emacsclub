Attention Hackers!

Is Eclipse slowing down your laptop? Have you reached the limits of Notepad++? Can you contort your fingers in gruesome positions? If so, perhaps it's time to learn a new editor...

Emacs Club is a new group at Penn whose goal will be to explore the power and usefulness of our favorite text editor. GNU Emacs is an extensible, customizable text editorâ€”and more. The ability to augment Emacs with your own (or others') code makes Emacs ideal for not only programming, but also many other classes of situational editing (organization, blogging, even editing web content on-the-fly!).

Throughout the semester, we'll learn as a group the basic and intermediate techniques of Emacs, with a focus on personalization and customization.

To learn more, join us for our General Interest Meeting this Thursday, January 19th at 6 PM in ___.
